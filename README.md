Version control repo for my solution to exercises from [Exercism](exercism.org), a platform for learning and improving your programming skills by solving code challenges.

## About Excercism

* Teaches coding against unit test.
* Your code is critiqued by real people who give you extra feedback for improving your solution.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you'll need to have the appropriate programming language and any necessary dependencies installed on your machine. Each solution file includes a brief description of the exercise and the problem it solves, along with the solution code.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions have passed the tests on Exercism, they may not be the most efficient or elegant solution possible. They are simply my own attempts at solving the exercises and should be used for reference or learning purposes only.
